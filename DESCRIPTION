Description: This package is a designed to provide an easy way to
    store all of your on the fly functions in one place.  Once saved
    when the package loads then all of the functions you've saved
    using the package will be reloaded.  This is a convenient alternative
    to writing your functions into a script so that they're all in one
    place.  Eventually the goal is to make it easy to turn the functions
    stored into 'local' into their own package.  Keep your eyes open
    for another package soon to come that will allow one to write documentation
    for functions made on the fly. Make sure that this package gets
    installed in a location that you have read/write access to or
    it will not work as intended.
